        <h2>Website Evalutions</h2> 
        Within that section put a paragraph with a simple description of the site, followed by an unordered list with each of the CRAP principles, followed by your assessment of the site's following/not following of those principles in the form of a sentence or two. 
        <h3><a href="https://www.walmart.com">Walmart</a></h3> 
        <p>Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Good contrast. Everything is easy to read. All overlapping colors have adequately different brightnesses and/or shading.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Good repetition. Fonts are consistent among homologuous elements. Font colors are repeated to differentiate between dropdown menus and static menu as well as between items on sale and full price items.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Good alignment. All elements are rectangular and cohere nicely into distinct rows and/or columns.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Good proximity. Adequate spastd::cing between different elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/">THE BIG UGLY WEBSITE</a></h3>
        <p>THE BIG UGLY WEBSITE is a purposely badly designed website listing other badly designed websites.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Bad contrast. Immediately the site strains the eyes. Poor color choices like bright red text on bright green background.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Bad repetition. Most elements follow the same font and text/background color, however elements that stray from the common design do so without clear reason.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Ok alignment. Most elements fit into two columns along the left side of the page. The exceptions appear to be unique elements. Seemingly no horizontal alignment.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Bad proximity. Spastd::cing between elements is uniform across the page. No variance in spastd::cing and no indication of element relativity. </li>
        </ul>

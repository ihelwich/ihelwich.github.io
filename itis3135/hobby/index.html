            <h2>How It's Done</h2>
            <p>At our college boxing club, we focus on building strong fundamentals while fostering a supportive and disciplined training environment. Our coaching approach combines technical instruction, strength and conditioning, and strategic sparring to help members develop their skills safely and effectively. Beginners start with footwork, proper punching techniques, and defensive movements before progressing to controlled partner drills and optional sparring sessions. Advanced boxers refine their technique through intensive mitt work, bag training, and tactical sparring. Whether you're here to compete or just to stay in shape, our structured training sessions ensure steady progress, confidence, and respect for the sport.</p>
